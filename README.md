          public function show ()
          {
                  $magic_role = new MagicRole();
                  $magic_role->chakeRole('PostController ', 'show');

 # use in blade
 to get role of the user 
 
       $role_user = ViewRoles::has_role();
 this will return name role as "admin" or "editor" etc
       
 to check if user have any role as "admin":
       
       $has_admin = ViewRoles::is_has_role("admin");
 this will return true or false 
       
 to check if user have permission as "show_Controller" :
 
       ViewRoles::is_has_permission("show_MagPermissionController");
  this will return true or false 
  
 example for check  if he has permission to show links :
  
               @if(ViewRoles::is_has_permission("show_PostController"))
                    <a href='" {{ URL::to('Post') }} Post </a>
               @endif
               
if you do not want use the defualt route you can use blade directory inside any page in view  :

     @mag_user
     @mag_role
     @mag_permission

just write anyone from this and will get a table or a form or both of them.
if you want edit style this tables or forms go to folder vendor/alsa7err90/magic_role7/src/view
and select any file you want to edit.
